For Part 1, I didn't need a graph. I used a simple recursive solution. That led to a memoization opportunity.

For Part 2, I used a [graph library](https://github.com/yourbasic/graph) that was somewhat clunky, but workable. I couldn't find a graph library that worked simply with interace{} nodes. That seems like the obvious approach to me, so there are probably complications I'm missing.

* Day 7 - (I) - done.

I == intcode
